      <p>I am a computational materials scientist who builds predictive models for materials, interfaces, and processes relevant to sustainable energy. I use Density Functional Theory, Molecular Dynamics, and Machine Learning to connect structure &rarr; mechanism &rarr; performance, and I develop workflows that scale from single calculations to high-throughput studies</p>
      <p>At Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, I investigate nanoconfined catalysis– how they are created, why they are stable, and how they enhance catalytic activity and selectivity. Part of it is highlighted in <a href="https://elements.lbl.gov/news/mechanics-of-a-floating-molecular-layer-for-reduction-of-carbon-dioxide/">Elements</a>. I also develop and benchmark MLIP-driven workflows for surface chemistry, including evaluations of FAIR Chemistry's UMA models on open catalysis and materials datasets to quantify accuracy, robustness, and practical tradeoffs for adsorption and reaction modeling.</p> 
      <p>During my PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I modeled gas and water transport through graphene-based membranes. I also built a reactive MD workflow to simulate carbon fiber manufacturing from low-cost pitch precursors, by modeling crosslinking reactions in heterogeneous organic molecules. My simulations reproduced key mechanical properties and revealed a new pathway towards affordable, high-performance carbon fibers, work that got featured in <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/carbon-fiber-lightweight-materials-0318">MIT News</a>.</p>
