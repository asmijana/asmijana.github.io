      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a computational materials scientist with a passion for solving complex problems at the intersection of atomistic modeling, materials design, and sustainable energy technologies. I use Density Functional Theory and (classical, reactive, ab initio, and machine learning-based) Molecular Dynamics. My postdoctoral research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory focuses on nanoconfined catalysis– how they are created, why they are stable, and how to do they enhance catalytic reactions. I obtained a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering from MIT (2022) where I worked on simulating gas and water permeation through graphene-based membranes. I simulated the carbon fibers manufacturing process from heterogeneous aromatic molecules which opened a new pathway of generating high-strength, low-cost carbon fibers.</p>
